# 💤 ETH Sleeping Giants Tracker

Track Ethereum wallets that have been inactive for a long time but suddenly woke up and made transactions.

## 🧠 Why?

Dormant wallets suddenly sending ETH may indicate large moves, selling pressure, or institutional movement.

## 🔍 What it does

- Scans a list of wallets
- Fetches their transaction history
- Identifies those inactive for 180+ days before resuming activity

## 🚀 Usage

### Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
